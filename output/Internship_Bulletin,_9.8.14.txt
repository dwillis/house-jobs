The House’s most unique and courageous conservative seeks smart,
happy interns (of all ages and backgrounds) for the remainder of the
year. Alas, we cannot pay you. Schedules and start/end dates are
negotiable if you’re worth it. We do not insist on specific, arbitrary
submissions: send us whatever personal materials you think will give
us reason to hire you, even if that’s just a standard boring resume and
canned cover letter. Writing samples are encouraged, but not required,
because even a short cover letter belies and betrays a lousy writer.
Brevity is the soul of wit.
This Member is not a jerk, and neither loathes nor avoids interns, but
loves them, and actually speaks to them. If you are selected for this
internship you will have extraordinary access to the Member and to
meaningful projects that go well beyond the standard intern grunt work
(or your money back).
Personality and ideology are important. Please bring a confident,
vigorous intellect and no drama. Ideal candidates will be true patriots
who can count up to 17 in trillions, and care more about future
generations than they do about sucking up to current leadership. Mushy
pleasers/appeasers keep walkin’. HINT: vapid granolas who fear guns,
hate babies, are ashamed of America, and think Islamic terrorists and
illegal aliens are just misunderstood will not be comfortable here.
