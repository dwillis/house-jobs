Internship Openings
Week of June 3, 2025
MEM-171-25
The office of U.S. Congressman Jeff Van Drew (Republican-NJ-02) is currently accepting
applications for his Washington, D.C. office for full and part-time interns for the fall
internship session. This is a conservative office, so each intern will be required to express
the Congressman's conservative perspective to constituents and people who call into the
office.
The start date would be as early as August 6th (flexible depending on availability) with a
flexible end date. Interns are paid a stipend based on availability and have access to transit
benefits. The internship will offer students and young professionals invaluable experience
with our nation’s legislative process. Interns contribute to the daily operations of the office
and are expected to act in a reliable, professional manner at all times. Duties include (but
are not limited to): greeting visitors, answering phones, leading tours of the Capitol,
opening and sorting mail, attending briefings, performing legislative research, and various
other tasks to assist staff. Congressman Van Drew supports students requesting credit for
their internship through their university.
