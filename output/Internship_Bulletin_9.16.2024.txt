Press interns will be responsible for compiling and distributing press clips,

The fellowship is ideal for candidates who have recently finished a graduate
program in international affairs or security studies, or have some prior work
experience in these issues and are looking to make a career transition or “try
out” working on Capitol Hill. Current graduate students who are able to work
during business hours will also be considered. Candidates with prior Capitol
Hill experience will also be given strong consideration, but Capitol Hill
experience is not required for this role.
Responsibilities will include drafting and advancing legislative proposals,
preparing the Member for hearings and markups, meeting with stakeholders and
constituents, providing vote recommendations, and performing additional tasks
as assigned.
Fellows will be provided with a monthly stipend. For Fellows who are able to
work full-time (40 hours per week), the stipend will be $3,200/month. The
office will also consider candidates able to work slightly less than full time (e.g.
30 hours per week), at a pro-rated monthly stipend amount.
Applicants should email a cover letter, resume, two writing samples, and three
references to Spanberger.Inquiries@mail.house.gov with “Foreign Affairs
Fellow – [Last Name]” as the subject line. Please include in your cover letter
your availability (preferred start and end dates, and hours per week).

basis of race, sex, color, age, religion, disability, national origin, uniformed
status, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Women, people of color, and
