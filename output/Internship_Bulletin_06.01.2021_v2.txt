INTERNSHIP VACANCY LISTING
Week of June 1, 2021

MEM-153-21

The Minority Staff of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, the chief
investigative body of the House of Representatives, is seeking full- and part-time
interns for the fall semester.
Interns will have the opportunity to work with the administrative, policy, and
press teams, conducting research, assisting during hearings and markups, and
helping with other administrative tasks as necessary.
Fall internships begin in August or September and typically run through the
middle of December. Specific dates for this internship will be determined on a
case-by-case basis, and preference will be afforded to those who are available at
least three days a week.
Applicants must be strong writers, organized, and detail-oriented, as they will
balance multiple, often disparate, projects corresponding with the broad
jurisdiction of the Committee. The strongest candidates will also exhibit
discretion in working on confidential matters and be enthusiastic and
knowledgeable about the Committee’s work. Previous experience on Capitol Hill
strongly desired, but not required. The position is unpaid, but we are happy to
work with an applicant so they can receive class credit.
Interested individuals should submit a cover letter and resume
to oversight.committee@mail.house.gov. Please place "INTERN" in the subject
line.

production of high-quality graphics, videos, and demonstratives, as well as rapid
response work, post-production editing, and livestreaming hybrid/virtual hearings
