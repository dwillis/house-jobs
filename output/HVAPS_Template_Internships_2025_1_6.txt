MEM-515-24
The Office of Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost (FL-10) is seeking an intern who is
passionate about public service to serve in our Washington, D.C. office for the Spring 2025
semester, which runs from January 20 to March 17, 2025. This is a paid internship at $18
per hour. The hours can be flexible, but we generally require 31 hours per week.
Interns primarily focus on administrative support to meet the needs of constituents who
contact the office, including answering phone calls and assisting with the coordination of
tour programs. Interns will also gain experience supporting to our legislative and/or
communications teams based on their interests and qualifications. Interns will have a
unique opportunity to gain insight into the workings of the U.S. House of Representatives
and federal government while serving the people of Central Florida.
Candidates who have lived in or have ties to Floridaâ€™s 10th congressional district are
preferred. Women, people of color, and other members of traditionally underrepresented
communities are strongly encouraged to apply. Interested applicants should apply by
January 7 on our website.
