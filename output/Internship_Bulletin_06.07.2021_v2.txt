The D.C. Office of Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) seeks interns for the upcoming Fall
2021 term. The D.C. office has two types of internships available: an in-person
internship and a remote, research-focused internship.
In-person intern responsibilities will include drafting social media posts for the
Member’s official social media pages (including Facebook, Twitter, and
Instagram), designing graphics, attending hearings and briefings (either in person
Page 1 of 3

or virtually from the office), researching legislation for both the Member and
legislative staff, drafting constituent letters on the Member’s behalf, interfacing
with constituents and visitors, staffing the front office, and potentially conducting
tours. To be considered for this position, candidates must show proof of full
COVID-19 vaccination, and if hired, agree to follow additional precautionary
measures, such as mask-wearing and regular sanitizing.
Remote intern responsibilities will similarly include drafting social media posts,
designing graphics, attending virtual hearings and briefings, and drafting
constituent letters on the Member’s behalf, but there will be a heavier focus on
conducting legislative research for both the Member and legislative staff.
All interns are paid $15.00 per hour for a minimum of 15 hours/week and
maximum of 40 hours/week unless the intern is receiving a stipend from an
external organization in relation to their internship. The Office of Rep. Ro
Khanna is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race,
ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, age, or socioeconomic status. All are welcome and encouraged to apply.
Applicants should send a resume, a short cover letter, two sample tweets on a
current event, and availability to julia.albertson@mail.house.gov. Additionally,
applicants should indicate which position (if you don’t have a preference, please
indicate that as well) you’re seeking, and include their vaccination status if
applying to the in-person internship.
Applications for the Fall 2021 Term will be considered until 11:59pm EST on
Monday July 26th, 2021.
