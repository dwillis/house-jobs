The office of Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-MT) is looking for interns for Fall 2018.
In the Washington, DC office, internships run throughout the fall, spring or
summer semesters for college students. Although all internships in all offices are
unpaid, students gain invaluable work experience. The hours are flexible to
accommodate students' hectic course schedules, but generally run 9:00 a.m. to
6:00 p.m. when Congress is in session, and 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. when not in
session.
In Washington, DC, interns' responsibilities will vary. They will be asked to
answer phones, run errands, research legislation for the Member and legislative
staff, attend hearings and briefings, and answer constituent letters on various
issues before the House. As a result, interns learn about the legislative process
and the many other functions of a congressional office.
U.S. Representative for the State of Montana. Greg Gianforte has a track record
as a businessman and entrepreneur, having launched and operated five successful
companies. Greg and his wife, Susan, founded their latest company, RightNow
Technologies, a cloud-based software provider, in their Montana home over 20
years ago. The company grew into Bozeman’s largest commercial employer,
Page 14 of 22

creating over 500 high-paying jobs. Greg continues to mentor aspiring
entrepreneurs across the state. As an electrical engineer, Greg has been solving
hard problems for decades. Greg’s top priorities are making sure the voices of
Montana are heard in Washington and protecting the Montana way of life from
federal overreach. Greg is focused on bringing accountability to Washington,
which has forgotten that the power rests with the people, not special interests. He
supports enacting term limits, banning members of Congress from becoming
lobbyists, and requiring members of Congress to balance the budget or not get
paid. Greg and Susan have been married for 29 years and raised their four
children in Bozeman, Montana. A strong supporter of Montana’s public lands,
Greg is an avid outdoorsman and sportsman. He enjoys hiking, hunting, fishing,
and backpacking. Greg could not have asked for a better place to raise his family
and build his business than Montana. Sworn into Congress in 2017, Greg is
honored and humbled to represent the people of Montana, and serves on the
House Committee on Natural Resources as well as the House Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform.
