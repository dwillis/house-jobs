The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) is the U.S. Senate’s
premiere investigative body and its oversight jurisdiction is extremely broad,
including issues related to national health, welfare, safety and security. The
Subcommittee is seeking an Oversight Counsel and an Investigator to help
navigate its various investigations and engage in interactions with Executive
Branch officials and private entities regarding PSI oversight efforts. This may
include conducting extensive record reviews and interviews with witnesses,
writing an assortment of products, including the drafting of PSI bipartisan staff
reports, in addition to supporting and advising PSI’s Chair (Senator Jon Ossoff)
and other PSI staff.
Both positions require a seasoned investigator or counsel who is energetic,
determined, thoughtful, and well organized with outstanding written and oral
communications skills. The individual should have experience investigating cases
of waste, fraud, abuse, corruption and/or mismanagement. The ability to work
well in a fast-paced environment with small teams and the ability to pursue
oversight opportunities on their own is critical. A calm and positive disposition
under demanding conditions and the ability to multitask under tight deadlines is
essential. Congressional experience is useful but not required. Investigative
reporters and others with investigative experience are encouraged to apply. This
is a unique opportunity to engage in in-depth congressional investigations. This is
not an entry-level position.
