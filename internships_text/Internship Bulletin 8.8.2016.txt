The office of Congressman Don Beyer is accepting applications for full-time unpaid internships beginning this early September in his Washington, DC office. Candidates should be eager to learn, self-motivated, with prudent judgment, with knowledge of politics, and a good sense of humor. The proximity of Virginia's 8th District means that there is a substantial amount of work in the areas of press, legislative research, and constituent services, and our interns get experience with a wide variety of responsibilities. To apply, please email resume, cover letter, and a 1-2 page writing sample to Pablo.Sierra@mail.house.gov. No walk-ins or calls please.
