Week of December 26, 2016
The Office of Rep. Justin Amash (MI-03) is seeking a bright, creative, and self-motivated economist or student of economics to join our Washington, DC-based policy team as a legislative assistant.
The legislative assistant will draft legislation, analyze bills, and meet with constituents concerning policy matters, among other duties. He or she will be expected to handle a diverse portfolio of policy issues, including budget and appropriations, commerce, defense, housing, social welfare, and taxation. The successful applicant will be a libertarian or classical liberal in the tradition of F.A. Hayek, Henry Hazlitt, and Frédéric Bastiat. He or she must demonstrate a strong commitment to individual liberty, economic freedom, the Rule of Law, and the Constitution.
The person also must be an excellent writer and clear thinker willing to take on the most serious impediments to a freer, more prosperous America. An individual who prefers staid and steady work or who avoids challenges (and the occasional failure) may be more comfortable elsewhere.
Applicants must have a BA or equivalent. A graduate degree in economics or at least two years of relevant policy experience is preferred, although Hill experience is not required.
